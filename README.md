# Item-Catalog
## Description
This is my Udacity Item Catalog, presented in a unique style a Mage and Magic skill editor. It is fairly common concept to have freedom to name your character, and decide on the skills. I may include a image upload capability, have yet to decide on that. 
The original intent was to use Flask-Bootstrap, however Bootstrap has been updated to version 4.0, while the last Flask-Bootstrap version used 3.0. Due to this, I will revisit this at a later time if FB is updated. 

## Contents

## Installation
1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
2. Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm
3. Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)
4. Write this Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).
5. Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)
6. Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally
