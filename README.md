# Item-Catalog
## Description
This is my Udacity Item Catalog, presented in a unique style a Mage and Magic skill editor. It is fairly common concept to have freedom to name your character, and decide on the skills. I may include a image upload capability, have yet to decide on that. 
The original intent was to use Flask-Bootstrap, however Bootstrap has been updated to version 4.0, while the last Flask-Bootstrap version used 3.0. Due to this, I will revisit this at a later time if FB is updated.
